# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following table lists which versions of the Threat Detection Dashboard currently receive security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v1.3.x  | ✅                 |
| v1.2.x  | ✅                 |
| v1.0.x  | ❌                 |
| < v1.0  | ❌                 |

Only the latest minor releases (v1.2.x and v1.3.x) are actively supported with security patches. Older pre-release versions and those prior to v1.0 are no longer maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** disclose it publicly in an issue or pull request.
2. Instead, report it **privately** by sending an email to **shrijabhavani@gmail.com**.
3. Include as much detail as possible: reproduction steps, impact assessment, and suggested remediation (if available).
4. You will receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**, and updates will be provided within **5 business days** of triage.

If a vulnerability is confirmed:

- A fix will be developed and tested.
- A new patch version will be released as soon as reasonably possible.
- Credit will be given to reporters if desired.

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.
